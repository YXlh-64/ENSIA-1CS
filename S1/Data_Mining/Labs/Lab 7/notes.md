* static NAT and public NAT use only IP translation, not port translation 
* Static NAT is ideal for web servers requiring consistent public IP addresses
* Dynamic NAT uses a pool of private IP addresses, which is not permanent 
* PAT (Port Address Translation) translates all the private IP @ + the port number to the same public IP address but different port numbers
